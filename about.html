            <h2 class="about-subheading">History</h2>
            <p class="common-text">Pickwick is a brand with an impressive and significant history. Since 1753, Pickwick has been a strong international tea brand. A brand full of flavour, which offers pure and natural products that can be enjoyed at any time of the day. Millions of people around the world drink one of the various and tasty Pickwick tea blends daily.</p>
            <p class="common-text">Since 1753, Douwe Egberts has gathered a lot of experience in creating different tea blends. In 1753 Egbert Douwe opened his first small shop in the Netherlands. He sold there cofee, tea, but also tobacco. Until April 1937, all tea was marketed under Douwe Egberts trademark. At that time, customers were given a tea box with drawing of an English mail van on it. This packaging was surprisingly popular and was the inspiration to find an English-sounding name for Douwe Egbert’s tea.</p>
            <p class="common-text">The president of Douwe Egberts at the time had a wife who was as fond of tea as she was of Charles Dickens’ books. Inspired by his short story “Pickwick Papers”, she suggested the name “Pickwick”. Since then, Douwe Egbert’s tea has been marketed under this brand name.</p>

            <h2 class="about-subheading" id="policyid">Policy</h2>
            <p class="common-text">Tea is a global beverage. Millions of people around the world are involved in the cultivation and production of tea. Therefore, we believe that the tea industry bears a great ethical responsibility and through Douwe Egbert’s Master Blenders (DEMB) we have commited ourselves to sustainable purchase of tea.</p>
            <p class="common-text">We achieve this through our membership of The Ethical Tea Partnership (ETP). The membership is in line with our efforts to contribute to long-term sustainability in the tea area and it is also a logical step towards our ambition to constantly contribute to sustainable business practices and compliance with high, ethical standards.</p>
            <p class="common-text">ETP works to monitor the conditions for tea production worldwide to ensure that the tea plantations comply with the home countries’ relevant laws and trade union agreements regarding employment (including minimum age and wage level), education, maternity, etc. ETP strives to work closely with tea producers and other stakeholders to promote an open dialogue to ensure adequate living and working conditions for the workers in the tea plantations and to strive for improvements where necessary. You can read more about ETP and their work <a href="https://www.ethicalteapartnership.org/" class="about-link">here</a>.</p>
